    /// 0x100 secondary alignment
    /// 0x200 not passing quality controls
    /// 0x400 PCR or optical duplicate
    /// Bit 0x4 is the only reliable place to tell whether the segment is unmapped. If 0x4 is set, no

    /// rst nor the last segment. If both 0x40 and 0x80 are unset, the index of the segment in 
    /// the template is unknown. This may happen for a non-linear template or the index is lost
    /// in data processing.
